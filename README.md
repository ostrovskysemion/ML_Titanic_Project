Titanic ML Flow Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is part of the Supervised Learning Flow assignment.
The goal is to build a complete machine learning pipeline for the Titanic dataset, predicting whether a passenger survived (Survived = 1) or not (Survived = 0).

Type of problem: Classification

Evaluation metric: F1-score (binary)

Dataset: titanic_train.csv, titanic_test.csv
